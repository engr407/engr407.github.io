																																																												<div class="title padding">Summing up the semester...</div>
																																																												<div class="content padding pink">This semester was an experience for me. I'm a transfer student and this was my first semester with in-person classes at State College. I'm majoring in Computer Science and the two entrepreneurship courses I took this semester were a breath of fresh air and acted as a break from the monotony. Balancing school work and my social life was not easy, and it took a serious toll on my mental health this semester. That is when I sat myself down, reflected, and came to the conclusion that I needed to be consistent and have a healthy balance between work and play. I started working on it, and I am doing much better from where I began.</div>

																																																																					<div class="title padding">Chef Creations</div>
																																																																					<div class="content padding beige">The premise of creativity in this class really excited me from the beginning and chef creations was the perfect way to start it. I texted a random number I found in the group for teaming up - my teammate was Ian. We met up to discuss ideas for our creation. Surprisingly, we found that there was no specific food that we both liked. Since we both enjoyed sweet flavors, we decided to create a dessert. I would give Ian more credit as he did most of the cooking, which I found to be the most difficult part. We ended up combining recipes and making something that was out of this world. Maybe I was just hungry that day, but it was one of the best desserts I've ever eaten.</div>

																																																																					<div class="title padding">Junkyard Wars</div>
																																																																					<div class="content padding beige">Junkyard Wars was the activity that got my creative juices flowing the most this semester. We had to create something out of nothing and I was thoroughly impressed with the class' ideas. When I saw a group present a possible solution to the water problem in Honduras, I was convinced they would be the winners. They did achieve that...   if you flip the numbers. After my initial surprise by the outcome, I came to the realization that although the presentation of the product matters, the value of your business is mostly dependent on the value that the product brings into the market - what problem does it solve?</div>

																																																																					<div class="title padding">Crash & Burn</div>
																																																																					<div class="content padding beige">For me, Crash & Burn was a sales activity. When we were given $5 and asked to make money, I came up with the idea of using Cashapp referrals to do so. My group and I decided to pursue it as our final idea as well. Initially, I was not on board because I thought we would not make enough money but I was proven wrong. We were the second-highest earners in the class which really solidified my faith in sales and marketing as a tool to further business. We set up tables in the HUB building and asked our acquaintances for referrals, and it worked! It was a great experience, other than the fact my group gave me a negative peer review that I disagreed with but I worked on improving myself given the advice.</div>
																																																																				</div>
																																																																				<div class="col text-box">
																																																																					<div class="title padding">New Business Competition</div>
																																																																					<div class="content padding beige">The New Business Competition got my creativity out again as we had to brainstorm, build and pitch an entire business in 3 weeks' time. My teammates and I came up with the idea for Packet Café, freeze-dried meals specifically targeted towards vegetarians and vegans who cannot find vegetarian meals or those that fulfill their nutritional needs. This hit home as this was a problem I faced personally since I started college. We used my experience to establish the fact that this market was underserved and their needs had to be met as there are serious implications for people who fall under this category. Our team was collaborative and we pushed each other to do better. This was a one-of-a-kind experience for me as I was able to do something concrete that would help me with starting my own business.</div>
